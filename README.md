hi im Taylan.

getting better at programming by finding challenging problems to solve in open source projects ðŸ™‚

currently working on OptimalHerbRun: a Java runelite plugin for old school runescape that optimises your Herb run by tracking herb growth, profit calculations and route setting/path finding

in the background: i am learning typescript, go and rust and intend to open source some projects that i've been working on in stealth.
